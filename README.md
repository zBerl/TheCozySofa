- **Google Analytics**: For detailed user behavior insights.
- **Contentful**: For content management.

## Environment Setup

1. **Contentful Setup**:

   - Create a space in Contentful
   - Create a Production environment
   - Get your Space ID and API keys:
     - Content Delivery API token
     - Content Preview API token

2. **Local Development**:

   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Fill in your Contentful credentials:
     ```
     CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=your_space_id
     CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_delivery_token
     CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_TOKEN=your_preview_token
     CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT=master  # Use 'master' for development
     ```

3. **Vercel Deployment**:
   - Add the same environment variables in your Vercel project settings
   - Important: All sensitive variables (tokens and IDs) must be available in all environments
   - Do not set any `target=development` restrictions for sensitive variables
   - Required variables:
     ```
     CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=your_space_id
     CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_delivery_token
     CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_TOKEN=your_preview_token
     CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT=Production  # Must be 'Production' for production builds
     ```
   - Safety measures:
     - The code includes checks to prevent using non-Production environments in production builds
     - Development environments should use `master` or your dev environment
     - Production deployments must use the `Production` environment
